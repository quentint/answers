== Description ==

Improve the usability of your Wordpress CMS system. This plug-in creates a dashboard widget with clearly labeled large buttons of the most common tasks one would perform when using wordpress as a content management system.

I have found that particularly when handing a Wordpress CMS over to less than tech-savvy clients, there is often confusion on how to perform some of the more simple tasks simply because the Wordpress side menu can be overwhelming. This plugin creates a simple to use dashboard interface that will let clients easily post, edit, manage users and change widgets with out having to do any hunting or searching.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.


1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure your settings through the new menu item on the settings tab (all buttons are turned off by default)

== Screenshots ==

1. The dashboard has a clear simple to use interface for using Wordpress as a content management system.
2. Options to turn on / off buttons as necessary.
